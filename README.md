##  Overview

<code>❯ Matsya Navigation is a real-time ship routing application that allows users to interactively track a ship’s current location, speed, course, and weather conditions. It calculates the best routes between Indian ports using data from the SeaRoutes API and visualizes these routes on a map with Folium. The application is built using the Dash framework, leveraging Bootstrap components for styling.</code>

---

##  Features

<code>❯ Key features of the application include real-time tracking of maritime routes, integration of weather data, a user-friendly interface for port selection, and a dynamic route calculation that takes into account various maritime conditions for optimal navigation.</code>
